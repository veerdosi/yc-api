  "long_description": "dScribe AI uses autonomous drones and Vision AI to monitor bulk inventory. These are things like grain and gravel piles for the ag and construction industry.\r\n\r\nToday most of the industry still relies on guesswork. Operators \"climb\" piles to eyeball volumes or wait months for expensive manual surveys, often off by 20–30%. That kind of error leads to seven-figure write-offs, misreported financials, and poor decision-making across supply chains.\r\n\r\nWe’ve lived this problem, and we know how to solve it. Warren saw it firsthand as a Product Manager at Milk Moovement, a $20M Series A AgTech startup, working closely with feed suppliers and farm managers. Jordan scaled Microsoft Azure’s largest public API, handling over 700M requests/month, and sold software to a public company. Cole was engineer #3 at Tropic, scaling it from seed to Series B, and later led engineering at an AI startup.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built an integrated hardware and software platform that’s now being piloted by some of the largest agriculture and construction companies in North America. As industries demand real-time visibility into the physical world, dScribe AI is positioned to become the system of record for inventory that don’t fit in traditional boxes and barcodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
