  "long_description": "We're building AI employees for commercial real estate (CRE) brokerages that are better than today's best analysts.\r\n\r\nWe're starting by automating the workflows done by human brokers while marketing commercial properties (creating listings, staging properties, drafting offering memorandums, and more). We save them time and enable them to personalize materials, so they can do more deals, improve conversion rates, and make more money.\r\n\r\nWe see this as our wedge into the market as we work towards our vision of building a full-stack AI system that handles all the repetitive and time-consuming parts of a CRE broker‚Äôs job (and eventually in other industries as well). \r\n\r\nWe envision a future where people in the industry are free from making decks and doing grunt work, so they can focus on the parts of the job they love (or just have more free time for pickleball üèì)!\r\n\r\nCurious?
